## 🧠 What I Learned & Challenges Faced

- Structured a scalable **multi-page React app** using React Router and Context API for global state management.
- Learned and applied **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive design — enabling clean layouts and dark mode support.
- Faced challenges aligning responsive **feature cards**, solved using Tailwind's `grid-cols` and `gap` utilities.
- Integrated **`html2pdf.js`** to generate downloadable, formatted PDF reports — overcame issues with rendering and export.
- Understood the importance of proper **routing fallback** using Netlify redirects for single-page applications.
- Gained hands-on experience with **Git**, GitHub version control, and **Netlify deployment pipelines**.
